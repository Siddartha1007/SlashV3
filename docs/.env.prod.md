# About SlashV3's .env.prod file
In the .env.prod file, the environment variable DATABASE_HOST is set to host.docker.internal. This configuration indicates that the FastAPI application, when running in a production environment, is expected to connect to a database that is running on the host machine.

# File Description
DATABASE_HOST=host.docker.internal: This sets the DATABASE_HOST environment variable to the value host.docker.internal. In a Docker environment, this special DNS name (host.docker.internal) is used to refer to the host machine from within a container. Therefore, it suggests that the FastAPI application, when in production, is connecting to a PostgreSQL database running on the host machine.
This setup is common when you have a database service (like PostgreSQL) running on the host machine, and you want your Dockerized application to connect to it. The host.docker.internal is a convenient way to refer to the host machine from within a Docker container.
