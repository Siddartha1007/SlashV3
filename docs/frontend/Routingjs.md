# File Description
Import Statements:

The file imports React and the necessary components from the react-router-dom library.
It also imports the routes array from an external routes.js file.
Routing Component:

The Routing function is a React component that renders the application's routes.
It returns a JSX structure that includes the Routes component.
Within the Routes component, it maps over the routes array and creates a Route element for each route.
Mapping Routes:

The routes array contains objects, each representing a route in the application.
For each route object, a Route element is created with the following attributes:
key: An index-based key to uniquely identify each route.
path: The URL path for the route.
element: The React component to be rendered when the route is matched.
Usage of External Routes Configuration:

The routes array is imported from an external routes.js file. This file likely contains the configuration for all the routes in the application.
Export:

The Routing component is exported as the default export of the file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

Hence, Routing.js provides a dynamic way to render routes in a React application by mapping over a configuration array (routes) and creating Route components for each route. The actual route configurations are defined in an external routes.js file.
