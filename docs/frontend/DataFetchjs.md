# File Description
Import:

The module imports the Axios library, which is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests.
Exported Function:

The DataFetch function is marked as async, indicating that it returns a promise.
It takes two parameters, site and item, which are used to construct the API endpoint.
API Endpoint Construction:

The apiUrl is retrieved from the environment variables using process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL. This allows the API URL to be dynamic and set based on the environment.
The site and item parameters are converted to lowercase.
The url variable is constructed based on the values of site and item.
If both site and item are "all," the endpoint is /all.
If only site is "all," the endpoint is /item/${item}.
If only item is "all," the endpoint is /${site}.
If neither is "all," the endpoint is /${item}/${site}.
HTTP Request:

The function uses axios.get to make a GET request to the constructed API endpoint (url).
It awaits the response, and if successful, it returns the data from the response.
Error Handling:

If there is an error during the HTTP request (e.g., network error, server error), the function catches the error.
It logs the error to the console and returns null.
Return Value:

The function returns the data fetched from the API if the request is successful; otherwise, it returns null.

Hence, DataFetch.js provides a reusable function (DataFetch) for making HTTP requests to a specified API endpoint based on the provided site and item parameters.
