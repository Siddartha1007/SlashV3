# File Description
Body Styles:
margin: 0;: Removes any default margin on the body element, ensuring a consistent layout with no extra space around the body content.
font-family: Specifies a font stack for the body text. This is a fallback mechanism, attempting to use system fonts and then falling back to a generic sans-serif font family if the specified fonts are not available.
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; and -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;: These properties are used to control font smoothing (antialiasing) on webkit (Chrome, Safari) and Gecko (Firefox) browsers, respectively. They aim to improve the readability of text by smoothing out jagged edges.

Code Styles:
font-family: Specifies a font stack for the code element, which is often used for displaying code snippets. It attempts to use specific monospaced fonts and falls back to a generic monospace font family if the specified fonts are not available.

Hence, these styles are setting a clean baseline for the body element, ensuring no default margins and specifying a font stack for better cross-browser consistency. Additionally, for the code element, it defines a font stack that prioritizes specific monospaced fonts commonly used for displaying code.
