# Location of Code file
(https://github.com/Siddartha1007/SlashV3/blob/main/frontend/src/index.js)

# File Description
Import Statements:
React and ReactDOM: Imports React and ReactDOM. ReactDOM is specifically imported from 'react-dom/client' instead of 'react-dom' for improved tree-shaking and smaller bundle sizes.
'./index.css': Imports the CSS file for styling.
'./App.js': Imports the main App component.
'./reportWebVitals.js': Imports a module for reporting web vitals (performance metrics).
'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css': Imports the Bootstrap CSS file for styling.

Create React Root:
Creates a React root using createRoot method. This is part of the Concurrent Mode API, allowing for concurrent rendering in React.

Render App Component:
Renders the App component within the React.StrictMode. StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in the application during development.

Performance Measurement (Optional):
Invokes the reportWebVitals function if you want to measure performance in your app. This function can log the results or send them to an analytics endpoint.

index.js is the entry point for a React application. It creates a React root, renders the App component within StrictMode, and optionally measures and reports web vitals. The ReactDOM.createRoot method is used for Concurrent Mode rendering, and the application's styling includes both the custom 'index.css' file and the Bootstrap CSS.
