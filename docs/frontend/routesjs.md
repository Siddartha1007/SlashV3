# About SlashV3's routes.js file 
The routes.js file exports an array of route objects. Each route object contains information about a specific route in your application, including the path, name, and the React component to be rendered when that route is accessed.

# File Description
Search Route:

Path: "/"
Name: "Search"
Component: Search (imported from "./SearchForm.js")
Data Route:

Path: "/data"
Name: "Data"
Component: DataDisplay (imported from "./DataDisplay.js")
Wishlist Route:

Path: "/wishlist"
Name: "Wishlist"
Component: WishlistPage (imported from "./WishlistPage.js")

These route definitions are structured for use with React Router. When a user navigates to a specific path, the corresponding React component (Search, DataDisplay, or WishlistPage) will be rendered as the main content of the application.

One can integrate these routes into the application by using the Routes and Route components from React Router.
