# File Description
reportWebVitals Function:
This function takes a callback function onPerfEntry as its parameter.

Check for onPerfEntry:
Checks if onPerfEntry is provided and is a function.

Importing 'web-vitals' Module:
Dynamically imports the 'web-vitals' module and extracts specific functions (getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB) from it.

Invoke Web Vitals Functions:
Invokes each of the extracted web vitals functions, passing the onPerfEntry callback to them.

Export reportWebVitals:
Exports the reportWebVitals function as the default export of the module.

Hence, this module provides a function (reportWebVitals) that, when called with a callback function (onPerfEntry), dynamically imports the 'web-vitals' module and uses specific functions from it to report various web vitals metrics. It is typically used in the index.js file to measure and report performance metrics during development.
