# File Description
DATABASE_HOST: This is an environment variable to specify the host of a database. In this case, it is set to host.docker.internal.
host.docker.internal: This is a special DNS name that Docker provides, and it resolves to the internal IP address used by the host machine. It's often used to connect from a Docker container to a service running on the host machine.

So, the .env.compose file, when used in a Docker Compose environment, sets the DATABASE_HOST environment variable to the value host.docker.internal, which could be used in the FastAPI application for connecting to a database running on the host machine.
