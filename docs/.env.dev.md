# About SlashV3's .env.dev file 
In the .env.dev file, the environment variable DATABASE_HOST is set to localhost. This configuration implies that the database (PostgreSQL, based on the code you provided) is expected to be running on the same machine where the Slash application is deployed.

# File Description
DATABASE_HOST=localhost: This sets the DATABASE_HOST environment variable to the value localhost. In the context of a database connection, this typically means that the database is expected to be running on the same machine (the local machine) where the FastAPI application is deployed.
When the FastAPI application is configured to use the .env.dev file, it will attempt to connect to a PostgreSQL database running on the same machine using localhost as the host address.
